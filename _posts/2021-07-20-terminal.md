### Elements

#### Terminal

The built-in terminal is satisfactory. I do not use terminal emulators like
iTerm2 as their main features can be reproduced.

#### Tmux

Multiple sessions, multiple windows, and split panes, can be achieved with
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). I usually have one pane for running a
local development server, and another pane for other miscellaneous commands.

#### Prompt

The command line prompt can be customised in the `.zshrc` file. My configuration
keeps it minimal, displaying only the current directory, and the git branch.

#### Zsh-autosuggestions

Autocomplete can be achieved with
[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions). It
looks through the local `.zsh_history` file and can help quickly find and run
long commands.

### Multiple machines

It can be an annoyance managing dotfiles when buying a new machine. To make
migration seamless, I have a Github repository of all my dotfiles and I wrote a
script to symlink them to the home folder. The symlinks act like pointers, so
when a program reads a dotfile in the home folder, the actual contents is in
another file. The repository ensures my dotfiles can be maintained in one folder
and kept under source control.

After buying a new machine, I can pull from my repository and run `symlink.sh`,
which then migrates all the settings.

### Custom prompt

File: `.zshrc`

```zsh
## zsh prompt
PROMPT='%B%K{044}%F{0}[%~]%k%f%b '

## display the current git branch
autoload -Uz vcs_info
precmd_vcs_info() { vcs_info }
precmd_functions+=( precmd_vcs_info )
setopt prompt_subst
RPROMPT=%B%K{48}%F{0}\$vcs_info_msg_0_$f
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '[%b]'

```

### symlink.sh

File: `symlink.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# list of dotfiles to be symlinked
files=("zshrc" "vimrc" "tmux.conf" "gitconfig" "gitignore")

# directory of the source dotfiles
# if the folder is located elsewhere, change accordingly
dir="${HOME}/dev/reborn"

echo "----Created symlinks----"

# symlink the files to the home folder
for file in "${files[@]}"; do
	ln -sf "${dir}/${file}" "${HOME}/.${file}"
	echo "${HOME}/.${file} -> ${dir}/${file} "
done

```
