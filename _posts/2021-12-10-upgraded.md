![terminal]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/upgraded.png)

My [previous terminal]({{site.baseurl}}/terminal) environment was quite
functional and I thought it was the endgame. But I was very wrong, and I now
believe I have reached true endgame. It is now both functional _and_ aesthetic.

#### Why Alacritty?

Alacritty is _supposedly_ the fastest emulator, but I switched from the built-in
macOS terminal since it allows for the borderless appearance. This can not be
reproduced with the built-in terminal.
